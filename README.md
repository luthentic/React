## Vite

### What's Vite:
Vite.js is a build tool that is designed to be fast and lightweight. It uses native ES modules and a native development server to provide a fast and seamless development experience. Vite. js also supports code splitting and hot reloading.

### Why Vite:
**The Problems:**

- Before native ES modules were available in browsers, developers used bundling tools (like webpack, Rollup, and Parcel) to concatenate and process source modules into browser-compatible files.
- Bundling allowed modular development but had performance limitations.
- As applications grew more complex, the amount of JavaScript increased significantly.
- Large-scale projects with thousands of modules faced performance bottlenecks.
- Dev servers took too long to start, and even with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), file edits had delays.
- In a bundler-based build setup, the dev server must eagerly crawl and build the entire application before serving it. This process can be time-consuming.

**Viteâ€™s Approach:**

- Native ES modules support in browsers.
- JavaScript tools written in compile-to-native languages.

**Dependencies:**

- Dependencies consist mostly of plain JavaScript code that doesnâ€™t change frequently during development.
- Some large dependencies (like component libraries with many modules) can be resource-intensive to process.
- Dependencies may be shipped in different module formats (e.g., ESM or CommonJS).
  
**Viteâ€™s Approach:**

- Vite addresses these issues by leveraging new advancements in the ecosystem.
- It takes advantage of native ES modules (ESM) in the browser.
- Vite pre-bundles dependencies using esbuild, which is written in Go.
- This pre-bundling process is significantly faster (10-100x) than traditional JavaScript-based bundlers like webpack or Rollup.

### two major parts:

- A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

## JSX:

- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.
- React developers often prefer JSX due to its conciseness, and itâ€™s commonly used in React codebases.
- In the past, web developers kept content (HTML), design (CSS), and logic (JavaScript) separate. However, as the web became more interactive, logic started influencing content.
- In React, rendering logic and markup coexist within the same placeâ€”components.
- Components are JavaScript functions that contain markup rendered by React. JSX represents this markup, resembling HTML but with stricter rules and support for dynamic information.

### The Rules of JSX:

1. Return a single root element:

```jsx
<div>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</div>
```

If you donâ€™t want to add an extra <div> to your markup, you can write <> and </> instead:

```js 
<>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</>
```
This empty tag is called a Fragment. Fragments let you group things without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree.

### Close all the tags:

JSX requires tags to be explicitly closed: self-closing tags like <img> must become <img />, and wrapping tags like <li>oranges must be written as <li>oranges</li>.

```js
<>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
   />
  <ul>
    <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
    <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
    <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>
  </ul>
</>
```

## Class Components:

### What are Class Components?
- Class components are JavaScript classes that inherit from React.Component.
- They have state, lifecycle methods, and can handle user interactions.
- Class components have been a fundamental part of React since its early days1.

### Creating a Class Component:
When creating a React class component:

- The componentâ€™s name must start with an uppercase letter.
- The component must include the extends React.Component statement, which creates an inheritance to React.Component and provides access to its functions.
- The component requires a render() method that returns HTML (JSX) representing the componentâ€™s output2.

```js
class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}
```


### State and Constructor:
**State:** In React, component properties (such as data that can change) are kept in an object called state.

**Constructor:** If your component has a constructor function, it gets called when the component is initiated. You can initialize properties (like state) in the constructor.

Use the super() statement to execute the parent componentâ€™s constructor function and inherit its functions.

```js
class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { color: "red" };
  }

  render() {
    return <h2>I am a {this.state.color} Car!</h2>;
  }
}
```

### Using State in a Class Component:
Class components can manage state using the this.state object. The state holds data that can change over time.

```js
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  incrementCount = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.incrementCount}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```


### Lifecycle Methods:
- Class components have lifecycle methods that allow you to perform actions at specific points during a componentâ€™s life cycle (e.g., when it mounts, updates, or unmounts).
- Common lifecycle methods include componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

```js
class Timer extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { seconds: 0 };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(() => {
      this.setState({ seconds: this.state.seconds + 1 });
    }, 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval);
  }

  render() {
    return <p>Seconds elapsed: {this.state.seconds}</p>;
  }
}
```

## Life Cycle:

### Functional Components Lifecycle Phases:
Function components have a simplified lifecycle compared to class components. They mainly focus on two phases:

- Mounting Phase: Occurs when a component is created and inserted into the DOM.
- Updating Phase: Triggers when a componentâ€™s state or props change.

### Mounting Phase:
During mounting, the following lifecycle methods are relevant for function components:

- useState: Used to manage component state within a function component.
- useEffect: Replaces lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

- useEffect runs after the initial render (similar to componentDidMount) and after every subsequent update.
- It handles side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions, DOM manipulation).

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Class Components Lifecycle Phases:

### Lifecycle Phases:
Class components go through several phases during their existence. These phases allow you to control the componentâ€™s behavior and perform specific actions at different stages.

The main lifecycle phases are:
- Mounting: Component creation and insertion into the DOM.
- Updating: Triggered when props or state change.
- Unmounting: Component removal from the DOM.

### Mounting Phase:

- During mounting, the following lifecycle methods are relevant for class components:
- constructor(): Called when the component is first created. Initialize state and bind methods here.
- render(): Generates the componentâ€™s virtual DOM representation based on current props and state.
- componentDidMount(): Invoked after the initial render. Use it for side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions).

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Counter;
```

### Updating Phase:
- When props or state change, the component re-renders. The following methods are relevant during updates:
- shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState): Allows you to optimize re-renders by deciding whether to proceed with the update.
- componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState): Executes after an update. Useful for handling side effects or additional logic.

### Unmounting Phase:
- When a component is removed from the DOM, the following method is called:
- componentWillUnmount(): Perform cleanup tasks (e.g., unsubscribing, clearing intervals) here.
